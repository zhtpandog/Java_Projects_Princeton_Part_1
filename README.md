Programming projects for Princeton Algorithms Part1

Hardcore Java Programming big projects.

Dependence: algs4.jar

Project1 - Percolation: Estimate the value of the percolation threshold in porous soil via Monte Carlo Similation. Algorithms: Fast Quick Union with Path Compression.

Project2 - Deques and Randomized Queues: Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. Algorithms: stack, queue, arrays, linked lists, generics, iterators, etc.

Project3 - Pattern Recognition & Collinear Points: Recognize line patterns in a given set of points. Algorithms: sorting.

Project4 - 8 Puzzle: Artificial Intelligence A-star Algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle problem. Algorithms: heaps, priority queues.

Project5 - Kd Trees: Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). Algorithms: Balanced Search Trees.
